<h3>Question 4</h3>
<ol>
<li>  	You have two patients: "Jerry" is a 43 year old man with a history of depression who tells 
		you his old college roommate came to visit and he had 3 beers while they watched a ball game. 
		"Billy" is a 21 year old man who tells you his girlfriend broke up with him and he drank 3 beers
	 	to help him deal with it. <br />
	 	Is the risk involved:
</li>
<input type="radio" name="question4" value="a"> Worse for Jerry because he is older.<br>
<input type="radio" name="question4" value="b"> Worse for Billy because he is drinking to cope.<br>
<input type="radio" name="question4" value="c"> Worse for Billy because he is drinking alone.<br>
<input type="radio" name="question4" value="d"> The same - it's the same amount of alcohol.<br>
<br />
